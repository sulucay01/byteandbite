With its launch came a venue for Boston locals and visitors to sample Executive Chef Jamie Mohn's tasty concoctions. The Dinner Menu boasts eclectic and delectable offerings such as Duxbury Mussels, Moroccan Lamb Tagine, or Lobster BLT. Chef Jamie's take on Mac and Cheese (with truffles), Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes and Skirt Steak Frites have already proven to be local favorites on the Carrie Nation menu. Carrie Nation is open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; serving lunch 7 days a week as well as offering a proper afternoon cocktail menu between lunch and dinner services. A chilled Raw Bar featuring a fresh assortment of seafood is available daily and the dessert menu features a lighthearted take on American staples. An immediate stand out is the tomato soup cake with cream cheese frosting. Served with candied bacon and fried basil, it is a complex rejuvenation of this classic Roaring '20s recipe.The main bar, heavily stocked with whiskeys, enticing cocktails, and a knowledgeable staff would surely be enough to have Carrie Nation herself pounding at the door, hatchet in hand. Its sleek design and ample seating allows for the signature cocktails (boasting the monikers of Cops & Robbers, Writers & Fighters, and so on) to keep the evening's conversations interesting and the drinks flowing well into the night. Walking up to the second floor, you are met with one more room, The Speakeasy, Beacon Hill's latest refuge delivering an intimate club feel for all. Pool tables, plush seating, and the lingering smell of bourbon provide a haven for a relaxing after-dinner drink.Aside from the nourishment and libations, Carrie Nation's team strives to give Boston a new and exciting guest experience, one that encourages thoughtful conversation and borrows a little inspiration from an iconic era of our great history.", "reviews": 216, "rating": 4.2, "link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60745-d4452240-Reviews-Carrie_Nation-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "email": "contact@carrienationcocktailclub.com", "phone": "+1 617-227-3100", "website": "http://www.carrienationcocktailclub.com", "featured_image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/b4/ad/e3/carrie-nation.jpg", "ranking": {"current_rank": 211, "total": 2472}, "address": "11 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108-3017", "detailed_address": {"street": "11 Beacon Street", "city": "Boston", "postal_code": "02108-3017", "state": "Massachusetts", "country_code": "US"}, "latitude": 42.358345, "longitude": -71.06148, "reviews_per_rating": {"1": 7, "2": 7, "3": 29, "4": 76, "5": 97}, "review_keywords": ["great cocktails", "wine list"], "is_open": false, "open_hours": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [{"open": "11:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "wed": [{"open": "11:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "thu": [{"open": "11:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "fri": [{"open": "11:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "sat": [{"open": "16:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}]}, "menu_link": null, "delivery_url": null, "price_range": "$$ - $$$", "cuisines": ["American", "Bar", "Contemporary"], "diets": ["Gluten free options"], "meal_types": ["Lunch", "Dinner", "Brunch", "Drinks"], "dining_options": ["Takeout", "Reservations", "Private Dining", "Seating", "Television", "Wheelchair Accessible", "Serves Alcohol", "Full Bar", "Accepts Credit Cards", "Table Service", "Gift Cards Available"], "owner_types": [], "top_tags": ["Mid-range", "American", "Bar", "Gluten free options"]}, {"id": 19100889, "name": "Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse", "description": "Delighting travelers with Davio's signature Northern Italian steaks, fresh seafood & handmade pastas, Chef/Restaurateur Steve DiFillippo brought Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse to Boston Logan International Airport's Terminal C & is open for breakfast, lunch & dinner service.

During extensive renovations in 2010 and 2011, owners Kenneth Osherow and Driscoll DoCanto transformed this former tavern into a warm and inviting space, opening the kitchen and creating additional window space for a well lit, open air environment. The hostess station, columns and exquisite bar were hand crafted by locals from salvaged Vermont oak. Most of the SBK staff originate from the surrounding community which enhances the neighborhood charm and relaxed environment. The SBK offers a diverse wine list with over 20 wines by the glass from all over the world and an extensive cocktail list featuring unique and exciting cocktails. The beer selection is equally diverse with over 20 bottles and draughts, including local Harpoon Brewery, Samuel Adams, and Berkshire Brewing Company selections. An added Tequila Bar offers over 30 quality tequilas from around the world and a list of house margaritas that are sure to please. The venue itself has a long and colorful history. Originally Bulldogs Tavern in the 70's, it was owned by Edward \"The Bull Dog\" Connors. After Bulldogs closed, the restaurant was re-christened the Rock Hill Tavern, as the Savin Hill neighborhood was previously known. It was then purchased around 2000 by Arthur Donovan, former proprietor of the once renowned Patty's Pantry on Dorchester Ave. The restaurant was remodeled as C.F.Donovan's and gained a loyal following as a neighborhood bar and restaurant. In 2009, C.F. Donovan's closed its doors. The building and restaurant were acquired by the current owners in August of 2010 and opened as the Savin Bar and Kitchen in March of the following year. With a long history as a vibrant eating and drinking establishment, the current owners plan to run a neighborhood gathering place for many years to come. The SBK continues to be a meeting ground for many locals, friends and neighbors. Patrons hail from all over the area including Savin Hill, Jones Hill, South Boston, throughout Dorchester, the South End and many surrounding towns and communities. From the entire SBK Team, we look forward to serving you very soon.", "reviews": 42, "rating": 3.9, "link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60745-d3820354-Reviews-Savin_Bar_Kitchen-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "email": "info@savinbarandkitchen.com", "phone": "+1 617-288-7500", "website": "http://www.savinbarandkitchen.com/", "featured_image": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/cc/cb/1d/savin-bar-kitchen.jpg", "ranking": {"current_rank": 730, "total": 2472}, "address": "112 Savin Hill Ave, Boston, MA 02125-3318", "detailed_address": {"street": "112 Savin Hill Ave", "city": "Boston", "postal_code": "02125-3318", "state": "Massachusetts", "country_code": "US"}, "latitude": 42.31171, "longitude": -71.05346, "reviews_per_rating": {"1": 1, "2": 3, "3": 11, "4": 13, "5": 14}, "review_keywords": ["steak tips"], "is_open": false, "open_hours": {"sun": [{"open": "10:00:00", "close": "15:00:00"}, {"open": "16:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "mon": [{"open": "16:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "tue": [{"open": "16:00:00", "close": "22:00:00"}], "wed": [{"open": "16:00:00", "close": "23:00:00"}], "thu": [{"open": "16:00:00", "close": "23:00:00"}], "fri": [{"open": "16:00:00", "close": "23:00:00"}], "sat": [{"open": "10:00:00", "close": "15:00:00"}, {"open": "16:00:00", "close": "23:00:00"}]}, "menu_link": null, "delivery_url": null, "price_range": "$$ - $$$", "cuisines": ["American", "Bar", "Pub"], "diets": [], "meal_types": ["Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner"], "dining_options": ["Takeout", "Reservations", "Seating", "Street Parking", "Television", "Wheelchair Accessible", "Serves Alcohol", "Full Bar", "Wine and Beer", "American Express", "Mastercard", "Visa", "Digital Payments", "Free Wifi", "Discover", "Accepts Credit Cards", "Table Service"], "owner_types": [], "top_tags": ["Mid-range", "American", "Bar"]}, {"id": 13545017, "name": "Bootleg Special", "description": "Visually stunning of Southern chic with an urban edge, Bootleg Special is a unique modern take on the classic inner-city speakeasies of the French Quarter.

Every town in Ireland has their own pub, a meeting place in which members of the community can gather to relax, celebrate, and bond over a pint or a song.

And many the many Irish ideas that immigrated their way across the Atlantic, the idea of the Pub was not left behind. Lansdowne Street has for decades been one of Boston's most popular destination - from the Red Sox to concerts and bars, the street had almost everything you could ask for.It is our pleasure to bring to you the combination of Irish culture and Boston heritage with a little Lansdowne Street flair.

"description": "Villa Mexico Cafe had its origins in Woburn, MA. Julie King, owner, manager, cook, cleaner and everything else, began the business with one purpose only: bring authentic Mexican food to the people of New England. Fast forward to 2006 with two businesses under the belt, an array of experiences, and stories to last a lifetime, the latest Villa Mexico Cafe opened in Boston. Serving authentic Mexican dishes like burritos, quesadillas, tacos, tostadas, fresh fruit waters and more, the business was inside the gas station store right in front of MGH. Its quirky location and energetic staff made it a special staple of the Beacon Hill neighborhood. In January 2013 the brick-and-mortar location was closed due to a building demolishing and rebuilding plan, but Villa Mexico Cafe continued its catering and salsa sales. The new storefront reopened on January 2016. As Momma King says, \"Hi my friends!

The restaurant also features a 15 seat bar that is open for walk-ins seven days a week. We are thrilled to be a part of this neighborhood and cannot wait to welcome you into our home.
