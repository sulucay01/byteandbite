Utensils are absent (unless otherwise requested), because in Ethiopia you eat with your hands by picking up your food with pieces of injera. Injera is the teff grain and wheat combination flatbread that will hold the various spiced meat and/or vegetable presentations known as 'wat's. There is a base layer of injera on which the 'wat' sits in your platter. More than half of our menu is vegan, and all of our entrees are gluten free (including a majority of the appetizers). Just remember to request the gluten free injera, which is made from 100% teff. The Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony is another experience we offer that makes Empress Taytu both unique and authentic. During this ceremony, we roast coffee beans from scratch and bring them out for you to see and smell. Then we grind the beans and brew your coffee the traditional Ethiopian way and serve your coffee in a handmade Ethiopian coffee pot (jebena) while burning frankincense.
